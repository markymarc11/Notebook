##Fun times if you're 3D
time for the class: talking about making the world 3D
##Find time to read all the articles for the beginning of the learnings

--lecture notes for this week

--gives you a way to export annotations
-to get annotations from a group, click api token, then go through group, and put group indentification
--its the 8 numberish in the url on the group page
-download to .csv if you want on excel
##intro to photogrammatery
- photogrammetry, its like a little look into all the cool things which we can do = computer vision
- many different ways to get it done currently, for conusmer grade apps and phones
--structure from motion, requites you to move around the object, instead of having the object move
--you can get stills from a movie if someone did a full video of something
-on the high end scale they use lazers!!!! better for getting the smallest little details, and can be very complex
-with all the fancy things, all you really need is a camera that takes a decent picture
- problems with digital history, shit dissappears a lot #blametheman
--therefore it is important to think of sustainability of stuff
-unity game engine, free for personal use
English heritage puts out a bunch of nuts and bolts type things
-basic idea of what you need for a print
--clean, clear type photographs from a variety of depth
--image matching, takes images and matches up the places of overlap, creating cloud of likely connnections
--once you figure it all out you can take this object and ad all the coolness to it, using it for different things
-when making pictures, try to take a decent amount of pictures, for a 360, do about 30-40 pictures
-how it works
--computer finds tie points
--lots of metadata is embeded in the data
--such as the size of teh image plate
--if you know all the info, the computer can figuer out where you where when taking the photograph
To make it all work, use meshlab, puts everything together
-if the app isnt working, we just need to take the pictures, and we can use the comps in the history computer lab and use photoscan
--quality stuff
