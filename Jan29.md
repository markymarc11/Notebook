Computational creatvitiy in history https://shawngraham.github.io/presentations/3812-jan29#/2
neuro networks
-scary stuff
-there are ways to map all the different ways in which we see something
-we see that depending on how you use certain tools can show you new views into history
-everything we do on the internet is tracked
-computer
--the transformation of one type of information into another
-when excavating, we can find an absense of something
-when making copies of something over and over again you lose a part of it each time
-archaeological record is shaped by force of persistency and permeability
-grids focus on the qualities of an object and define the assembly/dissassembly of objects
-to figure out how to understand an object, it is very compicated in the sense that there are so many variables contained in figuring out the quality of an object
-Hows everything have to do with computational creativity then?
