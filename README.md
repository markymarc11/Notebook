“If we stop interpreting, if we stop rehearsing, if we stop reproducing, the very existence of the original is at stake. It might stop having abundant copies and slowly disappear.” 
- what about those people who cannot visit Paris every day to visit the Louvre?
- what about authenticity? Who is looking for authenticity?
- collective memory
- but without these copies, would we value the original as much?
- What does originality mean?
- “The original although only in the name”
- The value of replications..
- Why are these objects replicated? 
- The “secondary”

 
- Which one is the reproduction?^
- Which one is more valuable?
- Botched Restoration of Jesus Fresco Miraculously Saves Spanish Town
- Subjectivity, reproductions with small defects are worth more than the original(ex: star wars figures, rare coins, stamps, defect bank notes)
-Mechanical reproduction of art gives more access to the masses. Original vs. cheap reproduction. An artist’s intention of their piece loses meaning as time goes on. The audience may perceive the piece of art entirely different than the artist or fellow audience members.

Censorship in restoring original paintings. 
- The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.
- Objects have a use biography 
- used and represented different ways throughout its life.

# Jan 15
# Fun times if you're 3D
time for the class: talking about making the world 3D
# Find time to read all the articles for the beginning of the learnings
- https://shawngraham.github.io/presentations/3812-jan15.html#/
- lecture notes for this week
- http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html
- gives you a way to export annotations
- to get annotations from a group, click api token, then go through group, and put group indentification
- its the 8 numberish in the url on the group page
- download to .csv if you want on excel
# intro to photogrammatery
- photogrammetry, its like a little look into all the cool things which we can do = computer vision
- many different ways to get it done currently, for conusmer grade apps and phones
- structure from motion, requites you to move around the object, instead of having the object move
- you can get stills from a movie if someone did a full video of something
- on the high end scale they use lazers!!!! better for getting the smallest little details, and can be very complex
- with all the fancy things, all you really need is a camera that takes a decent picture
- problems with digital history, shit dissappears a lot #blametheman
- therefore it is important to think of sustainability of stuff
- unity game engine, free for personal use
English heritage puts out a bunch of nuts and bolts type things
- basic idea of what you need for a print
-- clean, clear type photographs from a variety of depth
-- image matching, takes images and matches up the places of overlap, creating cloud of likely connnections
-- once you figure it all out you can take this object and ad all the coolness to it, using it for different things
- when making pictures, try to take a decent amount of pictures, for a 360, do about 30-40 pictures
- how it works
-- computer finds tie points
-- lots of metadata is embeded in the data
-- such as the size of teh image plate
-- if you know all the info, the computer can figuer out where you where when taking the photograph
To make it all work, use meshlab, puts everything together
- if the app isnt working, we just need to take the pictures, and we can use the comps in the history computer lab and use photoscan
-- quality stuff

Accord Project    group discussion page bit.ly/3812-collab-notes
 - how much is the object dependant on knowing what went into it
 - is the process more important than the product
    
  hOw does seeing a 3D model change how we see something. is it the same as if we were there in person
  
# Jan 29

Computational creatvitiy in history https://shawngraham.github.io/presentations/3812-jan29#/2
neuro networks
- scary stuff
- there are ways to map all the different ways in which we see something
- we see that depending on how you use certain tools can show you new views into history
- everything we do on the internet is tracked
- computer
-- the transformation of one type of information into another
- when excavating, we can find an absense of something
- when making copies of something over and over again you lose a part of it each time
- archaeological record is shaped by force of persistency and permeability
- grids focus on the qualities of an object and define the assembly/dissassembly of objects
- to figure out how to understand an object, it is very compicated in the sense that there are so many variables contained in figuring out the quality of an object
- Hows everything have to do with computational creativity then?

# History as a Remix

- we have the first object that we made, now what can we do with it to change it, how can we re-organize the information differently

February 5

- what is created also reflects on the creator
- Brian Foo, doing cool ways of representing data, REMIX
- not all remixes are equally valid
- odonnel university of lethbridge, unessay
- Deformance and interpretation
   Deformance always come back to the original
   why not look at the broken and twisted parts of it all - this deformation, it is not an end, but a means to an end
- remixing doesnt have to be that weird, just a way for you to see things for the first time
Sonification
- adding Sound to our model, or making the model into Sound
slides have a bunch of different things that can be done with the models
- meshing models together
-creative common licence is best 

ideas for the reading
- authoruity
- aura
- who is the author

Feb 12

- going forward with notes, keep a good idea of the lectures and discussions so that you can try to relate more to paradata
- important to have a good understanding of whats going on, and even writing down when you don't understand

-remixing
- mesh mixer
- reduce triangle or decimate the mesh
- makes model easier to work with and easier to mesh

lecture
- https://shawngraham.github.io/presentations/3812-feb12.html#/1
- idea of making casts of all the older pieces of art and architecture
- using the casts to show people what is and isnt good art
- the art was a sense of nationalism
- casts are not always enough though
- casts were helpful because they could be transported for a lot of people to see
- academic areas could have a good library of casts so you would still be able to study the casts even if you were unable to see the original
- Fascism museum from Mussolini
- shows only replicas, but gives the story that there are only ale to give casts because everythign was stolen from them, and that they will get it back
- museums and casts went from democratizing to being somethign thought of as not highly interesting for people
- casts fall out of fashion
- but then a realization that the casts were the only records left of the objects, because the originals were falling apart or gone
- there is a lot of questions surrounding whether we should be able to copy or scan most things in museums

the misuse of this data
- reputation management and mismanagement
- with all the digital stuff there is so much that can be done to change it for good or bad
- good article in the slides about the infrastrucure that needs to be set up to deal with all this stuff

William Carter
- what if we were to embed all the original info into the sculptures singular points 
- you would then still be able to see all the information from the original even if it was changed
- the idea that each of your cells contains all of your dna, so should each vertice hold that information in a 3D image

taking all the info is the data
organizing it in a way is metadata
describing how you did it is paradata

# Feb 26 module 3 Digital thing to digital world

- dhcu.ca/prairie-package-test/ 
- carleton university in minnesote has a tutorial on twine
 Virtual worlds of the past; an intro to games/history
- humans tell storys and they weave those stories into the landscape
- ARG alternate reality game
Chris crawford
- big video game designer
- left video games because of all the consumerism behind them
- game playing is a type of learning function
-  80's video games are good for learning in literature
- 90's  still decent
- after columbine, that all changed, they blamed video games for shootings
- the interaction in game has to be meaningful
- game spaces are safe,in the way that you can't actually get killed
- "video games can be ethical games if the choices you make have real consequences"
- MDA method, in the slide it is better explained
- we play games to know what happens next
-  historians like to know why things happened, and what could happen next
Simulation
- simulations are not oracle, they're interpretations
- interpretation that give way to further historical searching
procedural literacy, procedural Rhetorics
- a text adventure can be better than a visual adventure because people aren't trying to think of whats wrong with the image, you get to make the image yourself
Video Game
- ludology: study of games
- ludas: ru;e based
- pagea: free flowing
Alternate reality games
- games that take place in real space
- built around a series of different trends, idea that choices have change in the real world
- the idea of finding physical artifacts that move everything forwards
ARG's
- you have to think like a historian when doing it
- there can also be dangers for what happens
- fielddaylab.org/make/aris/ probably better for module 4 though

# march 5 Authenticity and the "Historical" Video Game

- Bohemia 15th century
- super interesting time, a bunch of stuff was happening
- talkinga bout a video game, which is supposed to be historically accurate
- retelling history is hard, because you have to say what is important or not and such
- Kingdom Come, video game

- supposed to be super historically accurate
- it can be looked at a case study to see how certain things are represented and not others (P.O.C. and women )
- the game represents certain values in a current contet (czech political views)
- you can find a lot out when you look at who in the game is considered to be important and how they are portrayed
- these same questions can be asked of museums as well
- games are a sequence of intereactions, some are important to the player, and others important to the game
-  graphics dont matter
- the only way we know the past is through vision
- if we are just worrying about graphics, we dont look at the full picture
- terra copplestone, was game developer, now in archaeology, for her graphics game be important for emotional effect
- key ponint, how representations are used or not used

# March 12 ArcheoGaming

- Video games eamples of built heritage
- the way that you look at games is the same that you would like at an  archaeological site
- a lot of people tend to just focus on the digital aspect of games, but there is also the audio which tends to take a back seat
- even when looking at "historical' games we can use them as learning tools, to help educate and learn
- 

# March 14
- Aurasma - hp reveal
- -lets you overlay stuff, photo recognizes trigger image and shows stuff
- Aris games, IOS only, looks at your location and tells you there is an experience there
- a playful intersection of digital space into the digital world

- bit.ly/2tJqYEo

# Module 4

# March 26
- Politics of (un)critical making
- Large amounts of technology come from military, HUD and such come into virtual reality and such
- augmented reality, just taking things into the regular environment
- breaks in reality are why problems with Virtual Reality arise (the breaks in presence)
- you don't really know what you can get with the augmented reality. so many possibilities.
- large parts of augmented reality missing, you usually only get the visual, and not things like audio or haptic feedback are given
- smell is a powerful cognitive trigger
- what can you do to bring out certain emotions and feelings by people
- where things are displayed has as much to say about what is being displayed
- Many software development kits are becoming bought up by big companies and then made obselete, giving them a form of monopoly on it
- making certain things less accessible because the big guys (Google and Apple) just wanna make taht paper
- even in academia, it is hard to make things happen because you have to reason for doingthings, and cannot just do them. 

# March 28

- looking at what the representations can show
- do they represent something that is good or bad
- does it change the meaning of the original object
- does it negatively change, the view on the object
- terry statue, when he is a centaur, he is just a man, because you only have the upper half, losing his leg in that sense
- if you copy something too much, what does it change
- a lot of the times we do things without thinking whether we should do it, or if it will hurt anyone
- imaginarysoundscape2.qosmo.jp  turning picture to sound
