“If we stop interpreting, if we stop rehearsing, if we stop reproducing, the very existence of the original is at stake. It might stop having abundant copies and slowly disappear.” 
- what about those people who cannot visit Paris every day to visit the Louvre?
- what about authenticity? Who is looking for authenticity?
- collective memory
- but without these copies, would we value the original as much?
What does originality mean?
“The original although only in the name”
The value of replications..
Why are these objects replicated? 
 The “secondary”

 
Which one is the reproduction?^
Which one is more valuable?
Botched Restoration of Jesus Fresco Miraculously Saves Spanish Town
Subjectivity, reproductions with small defects are worth more than the original(ex: star wars figures, rare coins, stamps, defect bank notes)
Mechanical reproduction of art gives more access to the masses. Original vs. cheap reproduction. An artist’s intention of their piece loses meaning as time goes on. The audience may perceive the piece of art entirely different than the artist or fellow audience members.  
Censorship in restoring original paintings. 
 The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.
Objects have a use biography - used and represented different ways throughout its life.

##Fun times if you're 3D
time for the class: talking about making the world 3D
##Find time to read all the articles for the beginning of the learnings
-https://shawngraham.github.io/presentations/3812-jan15.html#/
--lecture notes for this week
-http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html
--gives you a way to export annotations
-to get annotations from a group, click api token, then go through group, and put group indentification
--its the 8 numberish in the url on the group page
-download to .csv if you want on excel
##intro to photogrammatery
- photogrammetry, its like a little look into all the cool things which we can do = computer vision
- many different ways to get it done currently, for conusmer grade apps and phones
- structure from motion, requites you to move around the object, instead of having the object move
- you can get stills from a movie if someone did a full video of something
- on the high end scale they use lazers!!!! better for getting the smallest little details, and can be very complex
- with all the fancy things, all you really need is a camera that takes a decent picture
- problems with digital history, shit dissappears a lot #blametheman
- therefore it is important to think of sustainability of stuff
- unity game engine, free for personal use
English heritage puts out a bunch of nuts and bolts type things
- basic idea of what you need for a print
-- clean, clear type photographs from a variety of depth
-- image matching, takes images and matches up the places of overlap, creating cloud of likely connnections
-- once you figure it all out you can take this object and ad all the coolness to it, using it for different things
- when making pictures, try to take a decent amount of pictures, for a 360, do about 30-40 pictures
- how it works
-- computer finds tie points
-- lots of metadata is embeded in the data
-- such as the size of teh image plate
-- if you know all the info, the computer can figuer out where you where when taking the photograph
To make it all work, use meshlab, puts everything together
- if the app isnt working, we just need to take the pictures, and we can use the comps in the history computer lab and use photoscan
-- quality stuff

 - how much is the object dependant on knowing what went into it
 - is the process more important than the product
    
  hOw does seeing a 3D model change how we see something. is it the same as if we were there in person

Computational creatvitiy in history https://shawngraham.github.io/presentations/3812-jan29#/2
neuro networks
- scary stuff
- there are ways to map all the different ways in which we see something
- we see that depending on how you use certain tools can show you new views into history
- everything we do on the internet is tracked
- computer
-- the transformation of one type of information into another
- when excavating, we can find an absense of something
- when making copies of something over and over again you lose a part of it each time
- archaeological record is shaped by force of persistency and permeability
- grids focus on the qualities of an object and define the assembly/dissassembly of objects
- to figure out how to understand an object, it is very compicated in the sense that there are so many variables contained in figuring out the quality of an object
- Hows everything have to do with computational creativity then?
