So starting to use the scann3D has been an interesting experience
nto sure why but the picture kept on adding extra eyes to the scan
tried taking out some of the blurry pictures, but that didn't work out very well at all
still not sure what is wrong with it

-Started work on 3d project today Tuesday 16th
-took pictures of Terry Fox statue in front of parliament hill
-had to get on Matt's shoulders to take some of the higher pictures, hopefully they turn out well
-weather was a crappy out, lit bits of blowing snow, and a bit cloudy, could end up affecting the overal image
